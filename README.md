## 📖 About the project  

This is my **first full-stack project** built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**.  
The goal of this app is to practice building both **frontend and backend** inside Next.js.  

It includes:  
- ⚡ **Frontend** with React + TailwindCSS  
- ⚡ **API Routes** for backend (CRUD example)  
- ⚡ **Serverless deployment** on Vercel  

---

## ✨ Features  

- ✅ TailwindCSS setup out of the box  
- ✅ REST API with `GET`, `POST` and `DELETE`  
- ✅ Example CRUD for tasks  
- ✅ Easy deployment with Vercel
